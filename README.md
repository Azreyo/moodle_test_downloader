# Moodle Test Downloader
## This project is currently under development. Some features may not work properly or may not make complete sense yet.

Downloads moodle tests before teachers can hide them.

Still in development, some stuff might not work.

## Installation

Download from github and load it into your browser.

## How to use

1. Go to a public moodle test that shows results
2. Click the MTD icon
3. Click save when you want to save it (currently not working)

The test gets saved to IndexedDB in your browser (not yet).

## Note

Only works on tests that were public at least once. Can't download hidden tests.
